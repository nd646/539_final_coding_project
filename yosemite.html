                    <h2>Stargazing at Yosemite</h2>
                    <p>Stargazing in Yosemite is a popular and unforgettable experience, thanks to its clear skies and minimal light pollution. Glacier Point is one of the best spots, offering wide-open views of the night sky and iconic silhouettes like Half Dome under the stars. Tuolumne Meadows, with its high elevation, also provides stunning views and is a quieter setting for stargazing. For a unique perspective, head to Olmsted Point, where you can watch the Milky Way over granite peaks.</p>
