                    <h2>Moro Rock Trail</h2>
                    <p>The Moro Rock Trail is a short but exhilarating hike leading to the summit of Moro Rock, a massive granite dome. The trail is just 0.4 miles round trip, but its 350+ stone steps make it a steep and thrilling climb. Along the way, railings guide you past incredible views of the Sierra Nevada and the surrounding valleys. The effort is well worth it for the 360-degree panorama of the park at the top!</p>

                    <h2>Crescent Meadow</h2>
                    <p>Crescent Meadow is a peaceful, lush meadow nestled among towering sequoias. Also called the “Gem of the Sierra,” it's a great spot for a leisurely walk or a quiet picnic surrounded by nature. You might spot deer grazing in the meadow, colorful birds, or even a black bear wandering in the forest. Trails around the meadow offer chances to see wildlife and historic sites, like the fallen log cabin of conservationist Hale Tharp.</p>
